# StringCalculator
## TDD Exercise
### Purpose
Learn to use Test Driven Development to create a program.
### Description
This is a individual assignment.
1. Create a GitHub repository called StringCalculator
2. Share this repository with the teacher's account: "hap2000"
3. Programming language is JavaScript
4. **After each TDD cycle you need to create git commits with descriptive messages.** If a commit is missing for that step, no score is given for that step.
5. Make sure there are only files that are applicable for the project in the repository.
6. When the project is finished you turn in the URL to the GitHub repository in Canvas.

In this exercise you are going to solve a popular Coding Kata called String Calculator. This kata was created by Roy Osherove and is designed to help you learn TDD coding and refactoring.
